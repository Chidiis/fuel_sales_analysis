## SQL Project: Fuel Sales Analysis

### Description

This SQL project involves analyzing data related to daily fuel sales, inventory levels, and customer purchasing trends for a chain of gas stations. The goal is to derive insights to optimize inventory management, identify sales patterns, and understand customer behavior.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of the following tables:

1. **Sales**: Contains information about daily fuel sales, including date, fuel type, quantity sold, and revenue.
2. **Inventory**: Records inventory levels for each fuel type at the beginning and end of each day.
3. **Customers**: Provides demographic information about customers, including age, gender, and location.
4. **Transactions**: Logs transactions made by customers, including fuel purchases and payment methods.

### Objectives

1. Analyze daily fuel sales trends, including total sales revenue, quantity sold, and average transaction value.
2. Identify popular fuel types and variations in sales volume throughout the week or month.
3. Evaluate inventory turnover rates and identify potential stock shortages or excess inventory.
4. Explore customer purchasing trends, such as preferred fuel types, purchase frequency, and payment methods.
5. Identify correlations between customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

### Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Ensure data consistency across tables and resolve any discrepancies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Calculate summary statistics for key metrics such as total sales revenue, quantity sold, and inventory levels.
   - Visualize daily sales trends, inventory levels over time, and customer purchasing behavior using line charts, histograms, or heatmaps.
   - Conduct correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables, such as sales volume and customer demographics.

3. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Calculate daily, weekly, and monthly sales metrics, including total revenue, quantity sold, and average transaction value.
   - Identify peak sales periods, seasonal trends, and variations in sales volume by fuel type.

4. **Inventory Management**:
   - Calculate inventory turnover rates and days of inventory on hand for each fuel type.
   - Identify slow-moving or excess inventory items and recommend adjustments to purchasing or stocking strategies.
   
5. **Customer Analysis**:
   - Segment customers based on demographics, purchase frequency, and spending habits.
   - Analyze customer retention rates, repeat purchase behavior, and loyalty trends.
   - Identify patterns in payment methods used by customers and assess their impact on sales revenue.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Create visualizations and dashboards to present key findings and insights.
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis results, including actionable recommendations for optimizing sales, inventory management, and customer engagement.

### Tools

- SQL (for data querying and analysis)
- Python (for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for documenting the analysis process)

### Conclusion

This project aims to provide valuable insights into daily fuel sales, inventory management, and customer purchasing behavior to drive strategic decision-making and improve operational efficiency for the gas station chain.
